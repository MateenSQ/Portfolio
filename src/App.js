                        <p>
                            Hello, I'm Mateen. I was studying chemical engineering at a Loughborough University, but was dissatisfied with
                            mountains of studying throughout my life and nothing to show for it that I could be truly proud of, despite getting good grades. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After withdrawing, I contemplated my future, where I remembered learning HTML in middle school (Year 5-8). I researched it,
                            played around and made my first simple HTML page. <strong>I learned, applied and for the first time, made something that 
                            felt real - something I could be proud of</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From there, I learned about Software Engineering, a field with a unique blend of logic and creativity with a drive
                            for continuous improvement. A growth mindset has been part of my life since I was roughly 12 - 14 years old,
                            while I've always expressed creativity and logic through science, rugby, martial arts and games. It's an Industry
                            that feels like it was meant for me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My favourite part thus far of software development is gradually learning things that previously seemed so
                            out of reach or complicated. My most notable examples include Object Orientated Programming, design patterns,
                            authentication and authorization. I've never really felt quite so achieved in my life when I learned, understood
                            and applied these principles into my work.

                                    This is an inhouse piece of software I developed to for the members of Seacht and the Manging Directors of daughter companies 
                                    (including Saith - my workplace). It allows users to create, read, update and delete reports. It has authentication to ensure 
                                    only logged in users can access the app, and exercises authorization for resource access management.
                                    I wireframed, prototyped, designed, programmed and restructured (when needed) the entire thing myself.

                                        Garden Genie is an app designed to help anyone of any circumstance to start gardening. It considers a user's time, money and consistency.
                                        After 12 weeks of learning Web Dev from scratch, this was our final, 4 week full stack project made with a team of 5 other people I had never even
                                        spoken to before. We then presented our app and the journey to people interested in what we had made.

                                    <p>
                                        The app gets stuck when submitting the form. I imagine this happens
                                        due to the cold start nature of the backend, which it tries to access once the form is submitted. I find that
                                        completing the form, waiting 30-60 seconds, closing and reopening the app tends to make it work as expected.

                            <p>
                                Around October 2023 when I started working, I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PirateSoftware">Pirate Software</a>, who encouraged his viewers
                                to make games. I wanted another hobby I can devote time to outside of work, fitness and games, this seemed perfect.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At this time, he was hosting a game jam. I considered participating, but I had just started at my first software job and was still settling in and dealing with renting issues,
                                I didn't want to stress myself more by making it something I <strong>had</strong> to do.
                                
                                After a month of settling in and watching more of his context, I downloaded unreal engine and ran a First-Person-Shooter template project - and had
                                no idea what I was doing. I did some introspective thinking, and I eventually realised that as well as games, I have always loved
                                animation and animated shows. <strong>It became apparent that my love of games and animation were not separate - I know I would love to make something
                                that could create an enjoyable experience for another person. I have spent most of my life tempering my logic and problem-solving, but I have
                                equally loved creativity, and it was time I started leaning into it.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Back to considering game development: even though I'd have an advantage making games as I was learning C# (I assumed it somewhat translated to C++),
                                there was no reason I couldn't start learning art. I often think about .
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So I booted up Blender, again, having no idea what I was doing. But this time, I noticed that what I wanted to do required art skills, something I did not have.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>So</em>, I started learning to draw from simple online YouTube videos, pencil and paper in hand. After drawing and going through creators, I stumbled across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@YTartschool"> Marc Brunet</a>. He has a series called 
                                YouTube Art School where he offers lots of videos about fundamental art
                                skills, but also videos about about skill roadmaps (what order to learn things) creative process and mindset (including the growth mindset). After practicing 
                                under his encouraging and informative content, I decided to all-in on art.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Marc has a paid digital art course, and being so compelled with drawing and his content, I decided to make the hefty purchases
                                of software, hardware and the course to continue my art journey. To this day, I have not regretted it for a second. The thought
                                of taking steps towards of creating compelling artworks, developing a style, learning 3D software, learning animation techniques
                                is nothing short of brilliant.

                            <h4>Story Time</h4>
                            <p>
                                I was picked up rugby at around 13 in middle school, practicing in PE and the school club. At one point, a coach from a fairly local club came to offer
                                additional afterschool lessons, hoping to get a few interested and talented players to join the club he was in: Ampthill. A couple of people who also
                                practiced rugby at school also went to this club, and I eventually joined. Being part of a friendly, funny and damn good team was lots of fun.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Eventually, trials for the Northampton Saints Development Player Program (DPP) became available for people in school or local clubs. My clubmates
                                and I took part in the selection trials and a handful of us got in. We started having an advanced training session per week with people from
                                different clubs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A few more years later and another selection came around - this time for the Elite Player Development Program. A huge chunk of us got removed in the
                                selection. From our local club, only myself and four or so other club members got in. At this point, the training got quite a bit more serious
                                and after a year or more I slowly stopped having fun playing rugby. I was rather sad when I realised that I didn't want to do it anymore.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I quite enjoyed not having to go play rugby 3 times a week at first when I quit. It felt like a literal breath of fresh air. Eventually,
                                I thought that it would be worth picking up another sport. Volleyball crossed my mind, and I tried a bit of it in School and in clubs but
                                I didn't really enjoy the atmosphere of the club at the time. I came across Thai Boxing online one day and found a club near me that practices
                                Thai Boxing and Mixed Martial Arts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was good fun, and more physically intensive than anything I had ever done! There are so many skills to learn and a lot of room for creativity.
                                I practiced for a roughly 2 years on and off due to not really having too much money at the time. I didn't have the will power to study, partake
                                in clubs and work simultaneously.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I developed a pretty bad lower back problem at around 18, where I could hardly bend down, which was a shame as I was looking forward to MMA at
                                university.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As of now, I mainly keep fit in the gym. I try to employ functional training so that my muscles and fitness are primed for whenever I get back into
                                a sport.
